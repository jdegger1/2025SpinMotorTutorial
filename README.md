This project is code to make a command robot to spin a motor at a flat speed.\
It is heavily commented and I tried my best to go over some of the basics of both java and first programming.\
First start in MotorSubsystem, it covers:
- classes and objects  
- Instance variables  
- variable types  (public, private, final)
- primitive data types
- constructors and methods  
- and parameters and arguments

Then go to SpinMotorCmd, it covers:
- instance variables vs. local variables
- this
- addRequirements
- and initialize, execute, end, and is finished

Then go to RobotContainer, it covers:
- Use of subsystems and commands
- joysticks
- configureBindings
- and creating a Joystick button

When a constant is used, refer to Constants, it covers:
- Why we use constants
- and Static variables

Let me know if I should make any changes or if you have any questions!
